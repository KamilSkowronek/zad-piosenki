	<h1>Maroon 5</h1>
	<h2>Maps</h2>
	<p>
		I miss the taste of a sweeter life<br />
		I miss the conversation<br />
		I’m searching for a song tonight<br />
		I’m changing all of the stations<br />
		I like to think that we had it all<br />
		We drew a map to a better place<br />
		But on that road I took a fall<br />
		Oh baby why did you run away?<br />
	</p>
	<p>
		I was there for you<br />
		In your darkest times<br />
		I was there for you<br />
		In your darkest nights<br />
	</p>
	<p>
		But I wonder where were you?<br />
		When I was at my worst<br />
		Down on my knees<br />
		And you said you had my back<br />
		So I wonder where were you?<br />
		When all the roads you took came back to me<br />
		So I’m following the map that leads to you<br />
		The map that leads to you<br />
		Ain’t nothin' I can do<br />
		The map that leads to you<br />
		Following, following, following to you<br />
		The map that leads to you<br />
		Ain’t nothin' I can do<br />
		The map that leads to you<br />
		Following, following, following<br />
