 Woke up this morning from the strangest dream
 I was in the biggest army the world has ever seen
 We were marching as one
 On the road to the holy grail

 Started out seeking fortune and glory
 It's a short song but it's a hell of a story
 When you spend your lifetime trying to get your hands
 On the holy grail

 Well have you heard about the great crusade
 We ran into millions, but nobody got paid
 Yeah we raised four corners of the globe
 For the holy grail

 All the locals scattered, they were hiding in the snow
 We were so far from home, so how were we to know
 There'd be nothing left to plunder
 When we stumble on the holy grail

 We were full of beans
 But we were dying like flies
 And those big black birds, they were circling in the sky
 And you know what they say, yeah, nobody deserves to die

 You know I, I been searching for an easy way
 To escape this cold light of day
 I been high and I been low
 But I got nowhere else to go

 There's nowhere else to go

 Oh

 I followed orders
 God knows where I've been
 But I woke up alone
 All my wounds were clean
 I'm still here
 I'm still a fool for the holy grail

 I am, I'm a fool for the holy grail
